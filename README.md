## Hi there! 👋

I'm **Seyed M. Hossein Hosseini**, a Computer Vision Researcher & Engineer at **Elder Lab, York University**. 

My work bridges the gap between **3D Geometry** and **Generative AI**, moving from theoretical reconstruction to scalable, autonomous systems.

🔭 **Current Focus:**
* **3D Scene Understanding:** Metric depth estimation, Single-view geometry, Gaussian Splatting (GS).
* **Agentic AI:** Building autonomous RAG systems that "see" and reason (e.g., [VisualRAG](https://github.com/smh-hosseiny/visual-rag)).
* **MLOps:** Deploying vision models to production using Docker, AWS, and CI/CD.

Previously, I completed my B.Sc. at the **University of Tehran**, researching 3D reconstruction of axially symmetric objects.
