## Hey there!

I'm Seyed M. Hossein Hosseini, a Graduate Research Assistant at Elder Lab at York University. My research focuses on depth estimation and 3D scene understanding.

Previously, I completed my B.Sc. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Tehran, working under the guidance of Prof. Reshad Hosseini on 3D reconstruction of axially symmetric objects.

In addition to my core research interests, I'm also passionate about exploring other areas like medical image analysis and control engineering.
